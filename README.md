# Game
This is a game I've been making for fun for the past couple weeks

You are a square and the world is made out of squares, you can make minigames inside of it or just roam.
It is multiplayer but you can play it as singleplayer by entering nothing or "localhost" as the ip.
There is a public server at EDIT: public server no longer available

You can get a compiled jar from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-3cqA8Pg-GbwguHYvayOYEDRziU66mYK/view?usp=sharing

Commands:
To type in chat press T or / and to get a list of commands type /help and enter.
Really the only one that does anything interesting is /maze
